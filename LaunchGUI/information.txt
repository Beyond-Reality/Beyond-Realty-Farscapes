%acro% Farscapes is the first release of our next generation Beyond Reality mod packs for Minecraft Forge 1.11.2.\nNote that it is currently at an early release stage. While, from now-on, no world breaking-changes will be introduced intentionally; lots of mods are alpha versions or custom builds from unpublished development versions.\nAlways keep frequent backups of your worlds.\nPlease note that there is currently no balancing effort yet, as we are waiting for some specific mods and features to be released in this regard.\n\nDo not contact mod authors for issues when using %acro%.\n- Either contact BeyondReality Team on Discord: https://discord.me/BeyondReality\n- Or use our GitHub issues tracker: https://github.com/Beyond-Reality/Beyond-Realty-Farscapes/issues.
