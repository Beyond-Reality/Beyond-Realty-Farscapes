- Tweaks: Fixed the food tooltip not checking BWM's hardcore hunger status properly. (squeek502)
- World: Added Permafrost and Brimstone Walls.
- World: Fixed Basalt not spawning. You may need to delete that part of the config if you were having problems.

#### [Timberjack 1.11.2-1.5](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/timberjack/files/2433301)

1. Adds a custom falling entity, this allows various improvements:

 - Fixes the vanilla death timer bug on the entity. There should be no more floating entities left behind.
 - Tweak momentum values such that the tree falls approximately in away from the player. 10% chance of random direction.
 - Falling logs now destroy leaves and plants under them as they fall. Leaves also destroy plants.
 - When the entity can't place the block, it now properly spawns leaf drops.
 - Logs now drop 1-4 sticks instead of logs when the entity can't place the block. No more cheesing with slabs.
 - Logs now rotate in approximately the correct direction upon hitting the ground. May not work with all mod logs.
 - Properly trigger leaf decay checks after placing blocks.
2. Added an aggressive house protection mode:
 - Any blocks normally not found near trees will abort the felling process.
 - These blocks include: Glass, Workbenchs, Carpet, Anvils, Doors, Trap Doors, Signs, Beds, Repeaters, Comparators.
 - Can be disabled in the config, defaults to on.
3. Also:
 - Fixed a couple of issues with the chat commands.
 - Sneaking prevents felling. Can be turned off in config.
 - Added some code to clean up the old entities.
