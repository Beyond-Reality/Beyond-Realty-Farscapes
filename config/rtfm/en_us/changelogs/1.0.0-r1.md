# First release of **Beyond RealityFarscapes**

**Farscapes** is the first release of our next generation Beyond Reality mod packs for Minecraft Forge 1.11.2.

Note that this is currently at an early release stage.

- While, from now-on, no world breaking-changes will be introduced intentionally; lots of mods are alpha versions or custom builds, from unpublished development versions
- Always keep frequent backups of your worlds
- Also note that there is currently no balancing effort yet, as we are waiting for some specific mods and features to be released in this regard.
