#### [theoneprobe-1.1x-1.4.14](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/the-one-probe/files/2451902)

- Big optimization in network trafic and server load.   
  Previously when the client requested info from the server then it kept on doing that until the server finally replied.   
  This meant that too many packets were being sent to the server and the server had to calculate the information again and again.   
  Now the client is smarter and will not resend a request for info if it has already done that recently.

## 1.1.1-r1
