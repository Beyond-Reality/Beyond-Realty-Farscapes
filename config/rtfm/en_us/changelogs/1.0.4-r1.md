### Added mods

#### [TickDynamic-1.11.2-0.5.3](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tick-dynamic/files/2433038)

- Tick Dynamic is a Minecraft Forge CoreMod, which will attempt to maintain a server Ticks Per Second at 20. It does this by individually controlling how many Entities and TileEntities update each tick. As the server TPS goes down, the number of Entities and TileEntities that update each tick also goes down, to maintain a high server TPS.
